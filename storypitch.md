For my story idea, I took the campus hate crimes data and merged it with racial/ethnic demographic data for each U.S. campus from the Department of Education. 

The idea was to merge the datasets using pandas and see if there was any relationship between the level of racial and ethnic diversity on college campuses and  the number of racially or ethnically motivated hate crimes committed on each campus, with the hopes of finding comparisons with MU.

Two of the demands issued by Concerned Student 1950, the group of black students at MU that pushed for university president Tim Wolfe's resignation in November, called for recruiting more students of color and hiring more faculty of color. I wanted to see if actually fulfilling those demands could have any real impact on their own (increased diversity training/awareness/classes notwithstanding).

In my analysis, I learned that pandas is wonderful and immensely complex. I also found that there is a slightly negative relationship between the campus diversity indices and the number of racially or ethnically motivated hate crimes  on each campus. Same for total number of hate crimes, song both colleges with more than 1,000 students and more than 25,000 students. It would seem that there's a possibility that increased diversity has an impact.

My next step would be to talk to students at Michigan State and Penn State and Maryland, where there have been  more hate crimes than at MU and see what they've done to improve diversity, and more importantly, integration. I'd also look at the small colleges like Oberlin and see what's driving their numbers so high. And then I'd look at the big schools that with higher diversity/low hate crime numbers and see what they're doing right (if anything).
